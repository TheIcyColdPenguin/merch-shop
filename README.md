# Try it out

To run the server on a local machine -

-   Clone this repository
-   Open the terminal
-   (Optional, but recommended)  
     Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`  
     (Note: on MacOS, use `python3` instead of `python`)  
     And activate it using -
    -   Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    -   MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
-   Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
-   Run the app using `python main.py`  
    You will see a few prompts. To continue, simply press enter a couple times.
